# AudioECC
A Python project demonstrating audio encryption and decryption using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). This educational project showcases ECC principles applied to audio, including utilities for processing files, generating ECC keys, and visualizing original, encrypted, and decrypted signals. Note: ECC is slow for large multimedia files.
